*TA for CMSC25300: Mathematical Foundations for Machine Learning*

<!-- > This course is an introduction to key mathematical concepts at the heart of machine learning. The focus is on matrix methods and statistical models and features real-world applications ranging from classification and clustering to denoising and recommender systems. Mathematical topics covered include linear equations, regression, regularization, the singular value decomposition, iterative optimization algorithms, and probabilistic models. Machine learning topics include the LASSO, support vector machines, kernel methods, clustering, dictionary learning, neural networks, and deep learning. Students are expected to have taken a course in calculus and have exposure to numerical computing (e.g. Matlab, Python, Julia, or R). Knowledge of linear algebra and statistics is not assumed. -->
