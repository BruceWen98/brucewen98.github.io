I am an associate at the Singapore Economic Development Board, the lead government agency that plans and executes economic and industrial development strategies for Singapore.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Economics and Master's degree in Computer Science, both from the University of Chicago.

My academic interests are in Econometrics, Machine Learning, and Auction Theory.
