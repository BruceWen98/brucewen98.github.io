I recently graduated summa cum laude from the University of Chicago in June 2023, with a Bachelor's degree in Economics and Joint Master's degree in Computer Science. I am a member of Phi Beta Kappa and was chosen as a Student Marshal.

My academic interests are in Econometrics and Industrial Organization.
