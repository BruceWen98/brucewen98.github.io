## Works in Progress

### 1. [Reserve Prices in Art Auctions (joint with Kirill Ponomarev)](../files/auction_paper.pdf)
- **Abstract**: A large dataset of complete bids from the two largest auction houses in the world, Sotheby’s and Christie’s, is constructed via their YouTube livestream videos. Informative bounds on the number of bidders in each auction lot are also generated using audio transcripts from these videos. Using the top two bids in each auction lot and the estimated number of bidders, the profit bounds against reserve prices are estimated nonparametrically. To decide on a single best reserve price, the minimax-regret criterion is solved analytically and applied.
In some subsamples, we propose new reserve prices that significantly increase profits by at least 7.6% to at most 17.7%, equivalent to hundreds of thousands of dollars per individual auction lot, showing that significant profits are lost when setting reserve prices at the low estimate.
