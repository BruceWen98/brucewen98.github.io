## Works in Progress

### 1. [Reserve Prices in Art Auctions (joint with Kirill Ponomarev)](../files/auction_paper.pdf)
- **Abstract**: A large dataset of complete bids from the two largest auction houses in the world, Sotheby’s and Christie’s, is constructed via their YouTube livestream videos. Informative bounds on the number of bidders in each auction lot are also generated using audio transcripts from these videos. Using the top two bids in each auction lot and the estimated number of bidders, the profit bounds against reserve prices are estimated nonparametrically. To decide on a single best reserve price, the minimax-regret criterion is solved analytically and applied.
In some subsamples, we propose new reserve prices that significantly increase profits by at least 7.6% to at most 17.7%, equivalent to hundreds of thousands of dollars per individual auction lot, showing that significant profits are lost when setting reserve prices at the low estimate.

### 1. [Analysis of Google Ads Settings Over Time: Updated, Individualized, Accurate, and Filtered](https://doi.org/10.1145/3603216.3624968)
- **Abstract**: Advertising companies and data brokers often provide consumers access to a dashboard summarizing attributes they have collected or inferred about that user. These attributes can be used for targeted advertising. Several studies have examined the accuracy of these collected attributes or users' reactions to them. However, little is known about how these dashboards, and the associated attributes, change over time. Here, we report data from a week-long, longitudinal study (n=158) in which participants used a browser extension automatically capturing data from one dashboard, Google Ads Settings, after every fifth website the participant visited. The results show that Ads Settings is frequently updated, includes many attributes unique to only a single participant in our sample, and is approximately 90% accurate when assigning age and gender. We also find evidence that Ads Settings attributes may dynamically impact browsing behavior and may be filtered to remove sensitive interests.

### 2. [Low temperature molten salt preparation of nano-SnO<sub>2</sub> as anode for lithium-ion batteries](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2014.09.108)
- **Abstract**: We conduct the synthesis of nano-sized tin oxides by the one-pot molten salt method at low temperature. A sample of SnO<sub>2</sub> is obtained by heating a mixture of tin (II) chloride, lithium hydroxide and lithium nitrate at 180°C. The nano-sized SnO<sub>2</sub> powder is characterized using the techniques of X-ray diffraction, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area analysis, scanning and transmission electron microscopy and density analysis. The electrochemical properties are analysed using galvanostatic cycling and cyclic voltammetry. The results show that the SnO<sub>2</sub> prepared is a single phase material and shows reversible capacities of 471 and 767mAhg<sup>−1</sup> in the voltage ranges 0.005–1.0V and 0.005–3.0V vs. Li respectively, at a current rate of 100mAg<sup>−1</sup>. Reduction of Sn<sup>4+</sup> to Sn at characteristic cathodic peak potentials is observed in the initial and subsequent cycles of cathodic scan. Alloying and de-alloying reactions of Sn are observed at ~0.25 and ~0.5V vs. Li in the voltage range 0.005–1.0V, and the formation of Sn to SnO and SnO<sub>2</sub> is observed in the voltage range 0.005–3.0V vs. Li. Lower capacity fading is observed when cycled in the voltage range 0.005–1.0V as compared to 0.005–3.0V.
